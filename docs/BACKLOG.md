# Backlog

Known defects and leftovers, found by audit, **not yet decided on**. None of these are currently
breaking anything the user has reported. Do not fix one as a drive-by: they touch settings and state,
so each deserves its own change and its own version bump. Ask the user first.

Add to this file whenever you find something out of scope for your task. Delete entries you fix.

## Defects

none open (items 1 to 4 fixed in 1.6.4: condense switch, `dualMode` source of truth, single
bridge, glossary exports).

## Cosmetic / housekeeping

**5. The folder name says `v1.0.4`, the extension is many versions past that.** Renaming the folder means
re-running Load unpacked in Chrome, which creates a new extension id and **loses the stored API key
and settings**, so this is deliberately not done. Just do not trust the folder name.

**7. Two stylesheets, same design tokens.** `options.html` carries ~810 lines of inline CSS while
`popup.css` is a separate 923-line file, and they duplicate the same tokens with nothing shared.

**8. `legacy/old-splitter.js` duplicates a large Vietnamese compound-word lexicon** that
`vi-segmenter.js` also maintains. This one is intentional (frozen baseline) and should stay, but be
aware the lexicon exists twice and only one copy is live.

## No version control history before 2026-09-23

`git init` was run on 2026-09-23 with the whole 1.4.0 tree as the first commit. Everything from
v1.0.4 to v1.4.0 has no per-release history (`version-history.js` reconstructs it for the UI). The original v1.0.4 zip sits at
`~/Downloads/vietnamese-subtitle-translator-v1.0.4.zip` if you ever need the true starting point.
`README.md` is the closest thing to a changelog for that period; `grep -n '^#' README.md` gives the
index.
