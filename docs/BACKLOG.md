# Backlog

Known defects and leftovers, found by audit, **not yet decided on**. None of these are currently
breaking anything the user has reported. Do not fix one as a drive-by: they touch settings and state,
so each deserves its own change and its own version bump. Ask the user first.

Add to this file whenever you find something out of scope for your task. Delete entries you fix.

## Defects

none open (items 1 to 4 fixed in 1.6.4: condense switch, `dualMode` source of truth, single
bridge, glossary exports).

## Not built yet

**9. Site-specific caption sources for generic pages.** Udemy draws captions in its own DOM (no
text track; the public previews have no captions at all, so it could not be inspected); edX puts
the unit in a cross-origin iframe and its player's `data-metadata` holds `transcriptTranslationUrl`.
Both need a logged-in sample page to build against. The generic path (`SUBTITLE.md`) covers any
player that exposes standard text tracks.

## Found by the 1.7.4 audit, deliberately not fixed

**10. A late refine misses YouTube's per-video copy.** `ytGhiCache` saves once the last group is
translated; a background refine (`onRefined`) that lands after that is not in `ytcache4_`, so the
next visit shows the pre-refine line (no cost: the refined line is in the IndexedDB store). Rare.

**11. A refined line is voiced twice.** When a refine replaces a line whose Gemini TTS audio was
already made, the engine re-renders it (the words changed, so this is correct, but it pays twice for
that line). Holding TTS until a refine settles would delay the voice; not measured as worth it.

**12. Unmeasured: the first cache write after each service-worker wake lists every meta record**
(`TieredCache.ensureTotals`). Cheap for a small store; no IndexedDB in Node to measure a full one.

**13. The Gemini voice preview in Settings is not cached**: each click pays ~5 s of audio, about
0.1 to 0.3 US cents at the catalog's estimated prices. VieNeu previews are free.

**14. Coursera waits for a retranslation before showing a window** (`translateWindow` with
`realtime: false`): when the quality check asks for one (Cân bằng: severe issues only), that window
shows one Gemini round trip later. Kept: showing first and replacing later (as YouTube does) makes
the voice read the line twice, and Gemini TTS bills both.

**15. A long sentence with no clause or adjunct opener is read in one run** (a 22-syllable one: no
pause in 3 of 3 takes; the voice's own stops come before the 4.5 s breath point). A breath at the stop
nearest the middle would fix it but may keep a mid-phrase hesitation; decide after listening
(`tests/speech-bench.live.js`, sentence `ky-thuat`).

## Cosmetic / housekeeping

**5. The folder name says `v1.0.4`, the extension is many versions past that.** Renaming the folder means
re-running Load unpacked in Chrome, which creates a new extension id and **loses the stored API key
and settings**, so this is deliberately not done. Just do not trust the folder name.

**7. Two stylesheets, same design tokens.** `options.html` carries ~810 lines of inline CSS while
`popup.css` is a separate 923-line file, and they duplicate the same tokens with nothing shared.

**8. `legacy/old-splitter.js` duplicates a large Vietnamese compound-word lexicon** that
`vi-segmenter.js` also maintains. This one is intentional (frozen baseline) and should stay, but be
aware the lexicon exists twice and only one copy is live.

## No version control history before 2026-09-23

`git init` was run on 2026-09-23 with the whole 1.4.0 tree as the first commit. Everything from
v1.0.4 to v1.4.0 has no per-release history (`version-history.js` reconstructs it for the UI). The original v1.0.4 zip sits at
`~/Downloads/vietnamese-subtitle-translator-v1.0.4.zip` if you ever need the true starting point.
`README.md` is the closest thing to a changelog for that period; `grep -n '^#' README.md` gives the
index.
